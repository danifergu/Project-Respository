    <h1>History of Panama</h1>
    <h2>
        Panama was originally inhabited by the Native American tribes of the Cocl√© and Cuevas peoples. The first European to visit Panama was Rodrigo de Bastida in 1501. A year later, Christopher Columbus arrived and established the city of Darien.

   In 1513 Vasco de Balboa made his famous trek from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific across the Isthmus of Panama. This trip proved that the crossing could be made and turned Panama in to a major trading center. For years silver and gold were shipped in from other areas in the New World, carried across Panama, and then put on ships bound for Spain. The trip was dangerous and the road across Panama gained the nickname the Camino de Cruces or Road of the Crosses due to all the people who died along the way
