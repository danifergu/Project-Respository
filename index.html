 <h2 id= #about>About Me</h2>
  <p>My name is Daniel Ferguson, and I was born in Panama. I am 22 years old and decided that Babson was the best choice for me to further my education. This is my first real time coding since I had tried to code before, self-learning python but never really felt as interested. <img src="images/daniel.jpg" height="100px"> I have thought that taking a class would force myself to learn more and this was the case and helped me spark my interest in coding. I have lived my entire life in Panama, and have spent many summers in Spain, since my mother’s side of the family is from Barcelona.
  </p>
  <p>
    My father has always told me that to think about being an entrepreneur and always striving to learn something more. That’s why <a text-decoration:none; href="https://babson.edu">Babson College</a> and its focus on entrepreneurship was very important for me. Since it was something that resounded very much with what my father had taught me. After graduation I plan on working in the USA for at least a year in order to gain some experience working here before returning to Panama to work with my family’s business. I feel that the things that I have learned by living and possibly working in the United States will greatly help my family’s business back home.
  </p>


 <h2 id= #hobbies>My Interests</h2>
 <p> My main interests are soccer and tennis, which are the only two sports I have played since I grew up. My favorite soccer team is <a href="https://www.realmadrid.com/en">Real Madrid</a> (the best soccer team currently of course) and my favorite tennis player is Rafael Nadal. I obviously support them both since my mother was the person that introduced me to tennis and her favorite player was the best Spanish player at the time, Rafael Nadal.<img src="images/rafa.jpg" height="130"> After that I started playing tennis on the weekends and soccer with my school during the week. My father always supported Real Madrid while 	my mother supported Barcelona. I always liked Real Madrid more since I liked the kit way more.
